<h3>Description</h3>

This is a simple rapid-fire math drill with a two-minute timer.  There is no sound.  The app is free.<br>
No Wi-Fi or cell signal is required.<br><br>
	
The problem types are addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.<br><br>
	
At the end of two minutes, the number of correct and incorrect answers is displayed,<br>
along with the best correct thus far.  Twelve values are stored for future sessions:<br>
one for each of the 4 operations and 3 levels.<br><br>
  
On a settings page (for adults but with no restrictions) children may be added by name and assigned<br>
a level 1 - 3.  The name, level, chosen operation and 12 best-correct values are stored on your device<br>
for future sessions.<br><br

<h3>Instructions for the Adult</h3>
	
On first running the app, there is the option of adding a child's name.  One the home page the wheel at the bottom<br>
opens a settings page.  Here children can be added or deleted.  There are 3 levels of increasing difficulty,<br>
and a level can be chosen for the current child.  The clear-settings button sets the number of correct answers<br>
to zero (for all operations and levels) and the level to 1 for the current child.<br>
The operation is set to "add", and all best-correct values are set to zero.<br><br>
	
There is no penalty for incorrect answers.<br><br>
	
A picker on the home page allows selection of a child's name.  It defaults to the last child playing.<br><br>
	
There is no automatic progression between levels -- the settings page must be used.

previous best will be displayed.  If the number of correct answers if greater than zero,<br>
a ballopn animation will be displayed.  If you set a new record, a larger<br>
