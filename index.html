This is a simple math drill but with multiple reward animations.  There is no sound, no reading requirement,<br>
no keyboard entry (only button clicks).  There are no ads.<br><br>
	
The app starts with addition of numbers 1 through 5, then progresses to numbers adding up to 10,<br>
subtraction, missing addend, sequences, and greater-than/less-than.<br><br>
   
The child can view her number of correct answers, shown with an emoji for each one.<br><br>
	
If the child enters an incorrect answer, a hint image appears.  After 3 incorrect answers, incorrect answer buttons<br>
begin to be disabled in each further incorrect answer until only one is left.<br><br>

On a settings page (for adults but with no restrictions) children may be added by name and assigned<br>
a level 1 - 3.  The name, level and the number of correct answers are stored on your device for future<br>
sessions.

On first running the app, there is the option of adding a player.  Later the wheel at the bottom of the home page<br>
opens a settings page.  Here players can be added or deleted.  There are 3 levels of increasing difficulty,<br>
and a level can be chosen for the current player.  The clear-settings button sets the number of correct answers<br>
to zero and the level to 1 for the current player.
