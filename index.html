<h4>Kindergarten Math Drill</h4>

<h3 style="background-color: #EEE8AA">Description</h3>

This is a simple math drill but with multiple reward animations.  There is no sound, no reading requirement,<br>
no keyboard entry (only button clicks).<br><br>
	
The app starts with addition of numbers 1 through 5, then progresses to numbers adding up to 10,<br>
subtraction, missing addend, sequences, and greater-than/less-than.<br><br>
   
The child can view her number of correct answers, shown with an emoji for each one.<br><br>
	
If the child enters an incorrect answer, a hint image appears.  After 3 incorrect answers, incorrect answer buttons<br>
begin to be disabled in each further incorrect answer until only one is left.<br><br>

On a settings page (for adults but with no restrictions) children may be added by name and assigned<br>
a level 1 - 3.  The name, level and the number of correct answers are stored on your device for future<br>
sessions.
