<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>    

The developer does not collect any data from this app.
	
<h3>Description</h3>

This is a simple math drill but with multiple reward animations.  There is no sound, minimal reading requirement,<br>
no keyboard entry or dragging required (only button clicks).  The app is free, and there are no ads.<br>
No Wi-Fi or cell signal is required.<br><br>
	
The app starts with addition and subtraction, then progresses to missing addend, sequences, comparing numbers,<br>
base 10 blocks, fractions, 2D geometrical shapes, telling time, fractions, bar charts, and measurement.<br>
All problem types appear after 40 correct answers.<br><br>
	
The child can view the number of correct answers, shown with an emoji for each one.<br><br>
	
If the child enters an incorrect answer, a hint image appears.  After 2 incorrect answers, incorrect answer buttons<br>
become disabled on each further incorrect answer until only one is left to choose.<br><br>

On a settings page (for adults but with no restrictions) children may be added by name and assigned<br>
a level 1 - 3.  The name, level and the number of correct answers are stored on your device for future<br>
sessions.

<h3>Instructions for the Adult</h3>
	
On first running the app, there is the option of adding a child's name.  Later the wheel at the bottom of the home page<br>
opens a settings page.  Here children can be added or deleted.  There are 3 levels of increasing difficulty,<br>
and a level can be chosen for the current child.  The clear-settings button sets the number of correct answers<br>
to zero and the level to 1 for the current child.<br><br>
	
There is no penalty for incorrect answers.<br><br>
	
A picker on the home page allows selection of a child's name.  It defaults to the last child playing.<br><br>
	
There is no automatic progression between levels -- the settings page must be used.
		
<h3>Instructions for the Child</h3>

On the home page, choose your name if it's not already selected, or have an adult add your name.<br>
Click the green "Go" button, and look at the question.  Click one of the green buttons with the answer.<br>
If the answer is correct you can click the green arrow at the bottom to see the next problem.<br>
If the answer is incorrect, help will be provided.  Once you have at least one correct answer,<br>
you can click the gold button at the bottom to see an emoji for each correct answer.  The emoji contents<br>
will be scrolled if you have many of them.  The "back" button at the top returns you to the problems.<br><br>
	
After more than 2 incorrect answers, some of the answer buttons will be disabled, to guide you to the correct one.<br><br>	
	
The green next button can be clicked immediately after a correct answer.  You don't have to wait for the animations.<br><br>
	
After 3 incorrect answers, the next button will become enabled, allowing you to skip to the next problem.
